Darcy/Atwood [29/06/2025]
The choice of name is deliberate. Mr Darcy hails from Jane Austen’s novel *Pride and Prejudice* (1813), where he transforms from an aloof, privileged aristocrat into an introspective and morally evolved figure. Darcy acknowledges his failings, relinquishes his ingrained social prejudice, and performs selfless acts (most notably arranging Lydia Bennet’s marriage, thereby rescuing her family from social stigma), becoming a paragon of an alternative type of masculinity grounded in humility and responsibility. Fitzwilliam Darcy, then, suggests the possibility of male redemption and emotional recalibration, pushing against the tenets of orthodox masculinity. 

The act of slaughtering Mr Darcy is a poignant symbol of the fragility of alternative modes of masculinity. It takes place Gilead’s patriarchal framework. Committed by male Guardians who, despite their roles in facilitating the escape of the handmaids, resort to violence when confronted with Mr Darcy’s gentler form of masculinity. The death, a deliberate act of erasure, reflects a subconscious adherence to the patriarchal norms that valorise control and dominance. Thus Gilead’s patriarchal power structures are so entrenched that even subversive acts are co-opted into reinforcing the status quo. Their dual role highlights the paradox of those who oppose the regime’s masculinist dictates, while at the same time being corrupted by its influence. The Guardians’ actions are emblematic of a broader social pattern, where even those who resist the overt mechanisms of patriarchy can still be complicit in its underlying violence, inviting a critical examination of the potential for genuine transformation within a patriarchal system that perpetuates violence even among its dissenters. 

It also challenges the idea that rejecting overt forms of systemic violence is sufficient for the emergence of alternative masculinities. Rather, it suggests that genuine change requires a fundamental reimagining of power dynamics, one that transcends mere opposition to masculinist norms and embraces a commitment to empathy, equity, and non-violence.

Mr Darcy’s slaughter finds disturbing echoes in recent reports from private schools. Educational sociolgist Dr George Variyan’s recent research reveals that boys in private schools engage in ‘subterranean masculinities’—from hazing to non-consensual sexual image-sharing—as rites of passage to assert dominance.[^1] These practices, like the slaughter of the pig, ritualise violence in order to purge emotional complexity and shore up conformity. In both Gilead and real-world institutions, the same logic applies: male vulnerability is intolerable, so it must be eliminated—often violently.

To sum, the killing of the figurative Mr. Darcy in the TV adaptation of Atwood’s *The Handmaid’s Tale* serves as a stark reminder of the pervasive nature of patriarchal violence, and highlights the inherent challenges in cultivating alternative masculinities. It compels the  viewer to reflect on the complexities of resistance and the need for profound social change  in order to dismantle structures that perpetuate gendered violence and oppression.
