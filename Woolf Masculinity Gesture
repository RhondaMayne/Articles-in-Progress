‘Masculinity in Motion: Virginia Woolf’s Gestural Politics in *The Years*

Virginia Woolf’s *The Years* intricately choreographs the language of gesture as a vital site where masculinity is enacted, negotiated, and at times ruptured. Through subtle bodily movements and postures, Woolf reveals how gestures function as semiotic acts, communicating power, enacting refusal, and opening spaces for transformation within patriarchal structures. This essay examines three significant masculine gestures within the novel: the rigid, authority-asserting posture of Abel Pargiter; the charged act of Eleanor Murgatroyd removing her glove, which gestures toward refusal and control within gendered power dynamics; and the tender, pride-infused touch of Mr. Robson upon his daughter’s shoulder, a corporeal moment that quietly disrupts traditional paternal hierarchies. Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s theory of the ‘cultural politics of emotion’, I argue that these embodied acts do not merely symbolize masculine identity but actively redistribute emotional and social power. Ultimately, Woolf’s use of gesture reveals masculinity as a fluid, performative construct shaped through affective relations, offering a subtle but profound critique of patriarchal authority and opening possibilities for its transformation.
